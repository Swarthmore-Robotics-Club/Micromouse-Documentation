# Motors and Encoders

The motors are responsible for physically moving the mouse through the maze. There are many types of motors that a team can choose for their mouse. Two popular motor types are stepper motors and dc motors



One of the main problems introduced with dc motors is the fact that they are inherently unreliable.

## Driving straight: PID Loop
One of the biggest obstacles to overcome 

## Turning around corners

## Estimating our current position

## Coordinates to motor velocities: Differential-Drive to Unicycle model
